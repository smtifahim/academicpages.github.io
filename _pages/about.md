Welcome to my homepage! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Queen&#39;s University](http://www.queensu.ca/), [Kingston](https://www.cityofkingston.ca/home), Canada and currently involved with the[ COMPASS](http://pyxis.ece.queensu.ca/index.html) (COnstraint Models and PAtterns of Software and Security) Software Engineering Research Group at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am also involved with Queen's School of Computing as an Adjunct Assistant Professor. I received my PhD in Computing from Queen's, specializing in[ Ultra-Large Scale Software Systems](http://ulss.cs.queensu.ca/) (ULSS). Prior to joining Queen's University at Kingston, I was an [Ontological Engineer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_engineering) at the [Center for Research in Biological Systems](http://crbs.ucsd.edu/) (CRBS) at the [University of California](http://ucsd.edu/), [San Diego](http://www.sandiego.org/), [California](http://www.visitcalifornia.com/). I received my B.Sc. Honours and M.Sc. in Computer Science, both from [St. Francis Xavier University](http://stfx.ca/), [Antigonish](http://www.visitantigonish.ca/), [Nova Scotia](http://www.novascotia.com/). I love reading, watching football (soccer), cooking, creative writing, and [photography](http://photographic-fahim-imam.tumblr.com/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in AI. My research has been governed by the challenges of understanding the nature and extent of human reasoning that can be imitated by computing systems. I am specifically interested in investigating those aspects of human reasoning that require domain-specific knowledge and expertise. To me, effective representation of such knowledge is critical for developing any useful, AI-enhanced systems. So far, my research has led me to investigate and develop a number of representational facilities for a diverse range of applications. These include reasoning about the contradictory, inconsistent domain knowledge in healthcare systems, intelligent search and knowledge discovery mechanisms for neuroscience data and resources over the web, reasoning about the observations in different biological systems, representing the functional behaviour of event-based software systems, and most recently, representing the high-level specification of constraints that can be used to generate an automated intrusion-detection system for command and control systems.

My research has led me to explore various aspects of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) which include knowledge representation and automated reasoning, knowledge engineering and knowledge-based systems, ontologies and conceptual modelling, commonsense reasoning, cognitive computing, and functional reasoning in software specification and verification. I have a keen interest and experience in applying my core expertise in computer science to life science disciplines such as Neuroscience, Healthcare, and Biological Systems. I have always been interested in broad, multidisciplinary research projects that require significant knowledge and expertise in computer science theory and practices. I strongly believe that our ultimate worth as computer scientists should be assessed based on our ability to integrate our expertise with other academic disciplines.
